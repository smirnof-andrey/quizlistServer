## About Quizlet
Quizlet provides an opportunity to save information as flashcards.  
On the one side of a card you are supposed to put any item (term) you want to remember.
To the other side – an explanation (definition).
Then cards are consolidated to sets by topic. Such sets are called Modules.

Also, this service can be useful for all people who study anything.
